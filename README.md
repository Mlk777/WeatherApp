# Project : Twitch TV App

Last project of the four projects of intermediate front end development project section.

The goal was to request the twitch.tv api and display the status of some user. I had to respect the following user stories :

* `You can see whether some users in the list are streaming on Twitch.Tv`
* `It's possible to click on the status output to be sent directly to the user's channel.`
* `If a user is online it's possible to see some additional information about what's currently streamed.`

I decided to design it based on wood road sign.
If an user is online his status is green and you can see additional information passing your mouse over the sign.

**Particularities :**

* Design.
* Tooltip animation.
* Jquery properties.

**Skills :**

* API request.
* Javascript (Template literals, ES6 functions, jQuery).
* CSS (Variables, design, grid, tooltip).
